# Rational_Number_operator_overloading
Create a class RationalNumberwith the following capabilities:
A constructor that reduce or simplifies the input fractions that are not in reduced form.
Overload the addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/) operators for this class.
Overload the relational(>,>=) and equality(==) operators for this class.
A member function printRationalthat print the reduced form
After prompt two fractions, list the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, relational(> or <=), relational(>= or <) and equality(== or !=) of the two fractions sequentially.
Note: Inputs are all positive integer.
